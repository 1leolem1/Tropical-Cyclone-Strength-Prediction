For a smoother experience, you should run this project under Windows 11 (some versions of the packages aren't compatible with Windows 10, and you will then need to install manually the compatible version of some packages).

Please install python version 3.12.9

Ibtracs is a Data Set containing records of tropical storms in the USA from 1980 onwards.

Here is a notebook containing an EDA and a feature engineering of this Dataset in order to plan a pipelining of Machine Learning solution to predict the intensity of a storm. At the end of this notebook, we are tying different model of Machine Learning in order to achieve the objective.

All along the notebook you will dig with us in the exploration of the dataset and the different links we are making between the different variables inside. 

We strongly recommand to to clone the repository locally or on a virtual machine in order for it to work. You will then be able to read the data (LFS on Git Bash should be enabled).

Some cells may take several minutes to fully run depending on your computer specifications.

You will find in the spacial analysis of the dataset, an interractive map. You can play along with it, it retrace the storms we are intered in during the analysis of our data set. A slider is provided to choose a period of time.

We'll now leave you to enjoy reading this notebook, and hope that you'll be safe in case a storm starts.
